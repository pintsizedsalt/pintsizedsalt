Hello! I'm **Salt** 🧂, a 21-year-old budding developer. As a beginner in the coding world, I’m diving into **Python**, **C#**, and **PHP**, and exploring frameworks like **Laravel** and **CSS**. Right now, I’m crafting a note application for my current project. Beyond the realm of coding, I have a passion for cooking and music. My heart belongs to the comforting flavors of **Sinigang na buto-buto**, but my ultimate favorite is **him, ems**.

## 🌟 About Me
