# Welcome to the hub of my digital creations on GitHub! ðŸ§‚

I carry the name Salt, a whisper of flavor in the world's culinary symphony.

# ðŸ§‚ A Pint of Salt
Iâ€™m Salt, a 21-year-old budding developer. As a beginner in the coding world, Iâ€™m diving into Python, C#, and PHP, and exploring frameworks like Laravel and CSS. Right now, Iâ€™m crafting a note application for my current project. Beyond the realm of coding, I have a passion for cooking and music. My heart belongs to the comforting flavors of Sinigang na buto-buto, but my ultimate favorite is him, ems.

## ðŸ“‚ My Projects
- [Transaction App] (https://github.com/pintsizedsalt/Isaac-wad-practical-exam-bsis2.git): We were instructed to create a transaction application for our practical exam. (it's ugly so please stop da car jk)

- [Note App Project] (https://github.com/pintsizedsalt/backup-note-app.git): We were assigned to develop a note app, but keep your expectations lowâ€”it's not the best since we're just starting out.
